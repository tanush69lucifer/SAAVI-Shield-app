# 🛡️ SĀVI-Shield: Agentic AI Honeypot

**Traditional security is reactive; SĀVI-Shield is proactive.** Built for the GUVI HCL Hackathon 2026, SĀVI-Shield is a high-fidelity cybersecurity engine that deconstructs scam attempts using Agentic AI forensics.

## 🧠 The Intelligence: Sāvi & Zing
Our project personifies neural safety to bridge the gap between complex forensics and human intuition:
* **Sāvi (The Protective Sister):** The Forensics Expert. She performs deep psychological analysis on incoming threats, identifying triggers like *Urgency*, *Fear*, and *Authority*.
* **Zing (The Alert Brother):** The Interface. He ensures rapid detection and health-monitoring, translating complex backend data into instant, human-readable alerts.

## 🚀 Technical Architecture
* **Core Brain:** Gemini-3-Flash for sub-4-second forensic intelligence.
* **Backend:** FastAPI hosted on Render, hardened with `x-api-key` security.
* **Frontend:** Streamlit Cloud dashboard for real-time threat visualization.
* **Resilience:** Integrated health-pinger system ensuring 100% "Always-On" shield protection.

## 🛠️ How it Works
1.  **Ingestion:** The honeypot captures malicious payloads (SMS, Email, Links).
2.  **Deconstruction:** Sāvi identifies entities (URLs, Phones) and psychological tactics.
3.  **Agentic Response:** The system generates a "Bait Response" designed to engage and neutralize the attacker's intent.

## 📈 Impact
SĀVI-Shield moves beyond simple blocking. By understanding the *why* behind an attack, it provides actionable intelligence that traditional firewalls miss.
